Code for my code camp talk for 2014

What to expect
==============
This is a contrived, social camping app, partially inspired by some of the SPA example app that John Papa used. I aim to make a more "Social" experience by using Neo4j as the back end and having users Like and have discussions around a Session.

This serves as an example of how to leverage different angularjs providers and how to implement them in an SPA.

This can also serve as a backbone project for your SPA using angular and Typescript, as the project is already set up.  Just change your namespaces and hack away at it.

Why Typescript?
===============

I consider typescript to be the best path for C# coders to get their foot in the door with javascript programming.  While javascript is valid typescript, it introduces concepts that make javascript programming easier to "get" as a .net developer.

What's Next?
============
After reading about functionality at the type.litesolutions.net site, I'm interested in integrating them into this project to streamline creating new objects with appropriate interfaces.
